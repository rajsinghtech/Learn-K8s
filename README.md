# My CKA Journey Repository

Welcome to my CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator) journey repository! Here, I document my learning path and resources as I work towards becoming a Kubernetes expert. I have organized everything within an Obsidian Vault for a structured and organized learning experience.

## About Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an open-source container orchestration platform designed to automate the deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications. It provides a robust and flexible infrastructure for deploying, managing, and scaling applications in containers. Understanding Kubernetes is essential for anyone working in the field of DevOps, containerization, or cloud-native development.

In this repository, I've curated a collection of resources, notes, and tutorials that have been invaluable in my journey to mastering Kubernetes.

## Obsidian Vault

[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) is a versatile note-taking and knowledge management tool. I've created an Obsidian Vault to keep all my Kubernetes-related notes, documentation, and resources organized in one place. The Vault structure ensures easy navigation and quick access to the information I need as I progress in my CKA journey.

## Getting Started
