In Kubernetes, Kubelet is a fundamental component responsible for managing and maintaining individual nodes (or worker nodes) within a cluster. Each node in a Kubernetes cluster runs the Kubelet, which ensures that containers are running in Pods as expected.

Kubelet performs the following key tasks:
- **Pod Lifecycle Management:** Kubelet starts and stops containers inside Pods based on the desired state defined in the cluster's control plane.
- **Resource Monitoring:** It monitors resource usage of containers and reports this information to the control plane, enabling resource management and autoscaling.
- **Health Checks:** Kubelet regularly performs health checks on containers and restarts them if they fail.
- **Container Image Management:** Kubelet pulls container images as required, ensuring that the correct images are available on each node.
- **Node Status Reporting:** Kubelet reports the node's status and resource availability to the control plane.

Kubelet plays a crucial role in ensuring the overall health and operation of individual nodes in a Kubernetes cluster, making it an essential part of the Kubernetes architecture.
