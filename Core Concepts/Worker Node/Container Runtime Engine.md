# Kubernetes Container Runtimes README

## Introduction

This README provides an overview of Kubernetes Container Runtimes and their role within the Kubernetes ecosystem. Container runtimes are essential components responsible for running and managing containers in Kubernetes clusters.

## What is a Container Runtime?
A container runtime is the software responsible for the execution and management of containers. In a Kubernetes context, it plays a crucial role in deploying and managing containerized applications.
## Common Container Runtimes in Kubernetes
There are several container runtimes commonly used with Kubernetes:

### 1. Docker (Deprecated)
Docker was one of the earliest container runtimes used with Kubernetes. However, it has been deprecated in favor of other runtimes.
### 2. containerd (Industry Standard)
Containerd is an industry-standard container runtime that is lightweight and designed specifically for container orchestration. It is the default container runtime in Kubernetes starting from version 1.20.
### 3. CRI-O
CRI-O is an open-source container runtime designed explicitly for Kubernetes. It adheres to the Kubernetes Container Runtime Interface (CRI) and provides a minimal and secure runtime environment.
### 4. rkt (Rocket)
rkt, also known as Rocket, is a container runtime developed by CoreOS. While it is an alternative to Docker, it is less commonly used with Kubernetes compared to other runtimes.
